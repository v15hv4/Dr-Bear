## About


### Introduction

DrBear is a chatbot assistant for finance news, discussions on forums, tweets and other such features. It uses Sentiment Analysis to predict the health of a company based on how people talk about it. It has a web-app which does real-time scraping and implementation of NLP techniques for the above.

### About Investing

Investing is a task that needs a lot of background about any company. While many trading softwares do a cursory linear regression, such methods are useless at best and misleading at worst. A more informed user needs an assistant that assists and gives the necessary information. The market after all, is made of people, and what people like, sells.

### Technologies Involved

We have used Python for data-fetching and the Machine Learning models that we used, using various libraries such as tensorflow, nltk, and employing use of Regex for data cleaning. Our web-app has a React frontend and a Flask backend, and is hosted on a Azure platform, employing Dialogflow from GCP libraries for our chatbot.
